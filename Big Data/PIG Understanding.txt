APACHE PIG:
Platform for analyzing large data sets
Pig programs is that their structure is amenable to substantial parallelization, which in turns enables them to handle very large data sets.

PIG'S INFRASTRUCTURE LAYER consists of compiler that produces sequences of Map-Reduce programs.
PIG'S LANGUAGE LAYER currently consists of a textual language called PIG LATIN

KEY PROPERTIES
EASE OF PROGRAMMING :
 Execution of parallel task is simple
 Makes easy to write, maintain and execute.
 
OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES :
  Tasks are encoded permits the system to optimize their execution automatically
  
EXTENSIBILITY :
  Users can create their own functions to do special-purpose processing.
  
RUNNING PIG
Execute pig in various modes:
Interactive Mode:
Executed in local as well as Map/reduce mode.

Batch Mode:
Executed in local as well as Map/Reduce mode.

Execution Modes
Local Mode:
 Require access to a single machine; 
 all files are installed and 
 run using your local host and file system.
 Specify local mode using the -x flag (pig -x local).
 Example:
    /* local mode */
    $ pig -x local ...

Map Reduce Mode:
 Require access to a Hadoop cluster and HDFS installation.
 Mapreduce mode is the default mode;
 specify it using the -x flag (pig OR pig -x mapreduce). -x is optional
 Example:
	/* mapreduce mode */
	$ pig ...
	or
	$ pig -x mapreduce ..
 
Interactive Mode:
 Run Pig in interactive mode using the Grunt shell.
 Invoke the Grunt shell using the "pig" command.
